Next.js is a lightweight framework with pre-designed components in React. 
Pretty much like bootstrap but with React but only for server-rendered apps

Gatsby is the bootstrap of react with HTML and css included

Never erase the index.html file or the index.js file, as they are found by webpack to run the app

only the code written inside the src folder will be applied to the public one. The rest is used as 
documentation

the public folder contains everything what the user will see
